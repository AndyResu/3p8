# microcosm
EARLY-ACCESS PRE-ALPHA PROTOTYPE

A gamemode about spaceships on rp_downtown? Your guess is as good as mine.

## Instructions
- Set the server's workshop collection to this: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=133006390.
- Set the server's map to micro_downtown_v2.
- Set the server's gamemode to microcosm.
- It will either work or it will crash and burn for some unforseen reason, IDK.

## Development
Currently paused. In great need of a refactor. No new features being accepted.

Forking strongly discouraged.

Only submit a PR if it fixes a bug, exploit, or balancing issue.

I swear I will come back and work on this soon but I REALLY need a break for a few days.

Feel free to bitch about the horrible code but I'm not really capable of giving a damn right now.

## Credits
Parakeet/birdbrainswagtrain/Adam Coggeshall shitcoded this thing in about two weeks.

In addition, this gamemode would not be possible without
- The original creator of rp_downtown, The Pro(?).
- The many, many people behind Spacebuild and SBEP.
- Skylight, Pdan4, Ghettobunneh, Raubana, Zerf, and anyone I forgot who helped me test this.
