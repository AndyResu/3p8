
personal rules for my playthroughs of Fallout 4 that might be able to be applied to 3p8 gameplay philosophy
know what armor you have on before you leave
empty out your inv
have lots of ammo, more than enough. 
    make each shot valuable
make sure nades are unequiped
minimize distractions
    might be an interesting gmeplay mechanic- annoying sounds that allow you to play better once removed. like decoy stuff
don't enter a battle you know you won't win - i.e. don't fight a giant enemy
    have enemies much strong than the player they must avoid until they know they can fight. Goals ~ bosses
have extra supplies to avoid attrition, like food and stuff
equip your damn armor
watch out for landmines + grenades
OPTICS

3p8:
don't have a food/water mechanic for the player. 

Be wise to the time bet. Players invest their time into the game and are betting that against dieing in hardcore mode. 
    It puts an emotional investment into playing the game and not dieing like IRL, but also makes dieing a serious experience.
        Perhaps there is a way to get the emotional investment but without the emotional divestment?
